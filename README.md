# Tower-Of-Hanoi
 Tower of Hanoi Game
A simple and interactive game of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, built with Java and the Swing GUI framework. This project started as a way to better understand recursion and grew into a fun exploration of Java's GUI capabilities.

Interactive Gameplay: Use your mouse to drag and drop the disks between the three rods.
Rule Enforcement: The game won't let you place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
Move Counter: Keep track of how many moves you've made.
Win Condition: A "You Win!" message appears when you successfully solve the puzzle.
Simple UI: A clean and minimal interface built with Java Swing.

# How to Run the Game
You'll need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.

Download the Code: Download the .java files into a single folder on your computer.

Open a Terminal: Navigate to the folder where you saved the files using your command line or terminal.

Compile the Code: Run the following command to compile the Java files.

Bash

javac *.java
Run the Game: Run the main file. (You may need to replace MainGameFile with the actual name of your main Java file).

Bash

java MainGameFile
The game window should now appear!

# How to Play
The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from the starting rod to the destination rod (usually the last one).

You must follow two simple rules:

Move only one disk at a time.

A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

# Built With
